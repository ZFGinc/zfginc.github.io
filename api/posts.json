Let me tell you, it is an unforgettable experience!<br>I met some good guys and for the first time I did a project with a tight time frame. I already had texture sketches, but I didn't know where to use them.<br><br>After Game Jam, I decided not to abandon the project, but to continue to support it. <img width=\"570\" align=\"center\" style=\"width: 366px;\" class=\"fr-dib fr-fic fr-fil\" src=\"../images/posts/8bit-preview.png\"> This is how the 8-Bit RPG was born!<br><br>At the moment it's still a bit raw in some places, but thanks to it I've gained a lot of new skills in programming and promotion.<br><br>You can download the game from <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ZFGinc.EightBitMagicWar\">THIS LINK</a>.<br><br>Have a nice game!"
